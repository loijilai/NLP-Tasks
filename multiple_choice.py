## Load SWAG dataset

Start by loading the `regular` configuration of the SWAG dataset from the ðŸ¤— Datasets library:
"""

from datasets import load_dataset

swag = load_dataset("swag", "regular")

"""Then take a look at an example:"""

swag["train"][0]

swag.keys()

swag["test"][0]

"""While it looks like there are a lot of fields here, it is actually pretty straightforward:

- `sent1` and `sent2`: these fields show how a sentence starts, and if you put the two together, you get the `startphrase` field.
- `ending`: suggests a possible ending for how a sentence can end, but only one of them is correct.
- `label`: identifies the correct sentence ending.

## Preprocess

The next step is to load a BERT tokenizer to process the sentence starts and the four possible endings:
"""

from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

"""The preprocessing function you want to create needs to:

1. Make four copies of the `sent1` field and combine each of them with `sent2` to recreate how a sentence starts.
2. Combine `sent2` with each of the four possible sentence endings.
3. Flatten these two lists so you can tokenize them, and then unflatten them afterward so each example has a corresponding `input_ids`, `attention_mask`, and `labels` field.
"""

ending_names = ["ending0", "ending1", "ending2", "ending3"]


def preprocess_function(examples):
    first_sentences = [] # [["hello", "hello", "hello", "hello"]]
    for context in examples["sent1"]:
        first_sentences.append([context] * 4)

    question_headers = examples["sent2"]
    second_sentences = [
        [f"{header} {examples[end][i]}" for end in ending_names] for i, header in enumerate(question_headers)
    ]

    second_sentences = sum(second_sentences, [])

    tokenized_examples = tokenizer(first_sentences, second_sentences, truncation=True)
    return {k: [v[i : i + 4] for i in range(0, len(v), 4)] for k, v in tokenized_examples.items()}

"""To apply the preprocessing function over the entire dataset, use ðŸ¤— Datasets [map](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/main/en/package_reference/main_classes#datasets.Dataset.map) method. You can speed up the `map` function by setting `batched=True` to process multiple elements of the dataset at once:"""

"""ðŸ¤— Transformers doesn't have a data collator for multiple choice, so you'll need to adapt the [DataCollatorWithPadding](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/data_collator#transformers.DataCollatorWithPadding) to create a batch of examples. It's more efficient to *dynamically pad* the sentences to the longest length in a batch during collation, instead of padding the whole dataset to the maximum length.

`DataCollatorForMultipleChoice` flattens all the model inputs, applies padding, and then unflattens the results:

Including a metric during training is often helpful for evaluating your model's performance.

## Train

<Tip>

If you aren't familiar with finetuning a model with the [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer), take a look at the basic tutorial [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/tasks/../training#train-with-pytorch-trainer)!

You're ready to start training your model now! Load BERT with [AutoModelForMultipleChoice](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForMultipleChoice):

1. Define your training hyperparameters in [TrainingArguments](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments). The only required parameter is `output_dir` which specifies where to save your model. You'll push this model to the Hub by setting `push_to_hub=True` (you need to be signed in to Hugging Face to upload your model). At the end of each epoch, the [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer) will evaluate the accuracy and save the training checkpoint.
2. Pass the training arguments to [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer) along with the model, dataset, tokenizer, data collator, and `compute_metrics` function.
3. Call [train()](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer.train) to finetune your model.
